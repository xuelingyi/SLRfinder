Data were obtained from the published whole-genome sequencing of 887 wild individuals of Pungitius pungitius in Feng et al. (Feng, X., Merilä, J., & Löytynoja, A. (2022). Complex population history affects admixture analyses in nine‐spined sticklebacks. Molecular Ecology, 31(20), 5386-5401. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.16651). 

Datasets are generated based on the characterized sex-determining regions (SDRs) in Yi et al. (in prep). 

Total 13 datasets: 
1. ELpop27: total 27 poplations sexed by the LG12 SDR, total 558 individuals
2. WLpop7: total 7 populations sexed by the LG3 SDR, total 146 individuals
3. 11 datasets each containing one population:
the 5 non-European populations: RUS-LEN, JAP-BIW, USA-HLA, CAN-FLO, CAN-TEM
the 4 EU populations of unknown SDR (based on Yi et al.): SCO-HAR, GBR-GRO, FRA-VEY, SWE-NAV
one population identified with only females: FIN-KRK (the non-European population CAN-TEM also has females only)
one population where both LG3 and LG12 SDRs coexist: POL-GDY
